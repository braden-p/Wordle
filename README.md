## DESCRIPTION
A copy of the popular game, Wordle, with implementations in Python and C.
In this version, the user can choose the length of the word ranging from
5 to 8 letters words. The user has a set number of guesses to guess the
correct word.
Unlike the original wordle game, this version does not check if the user
input is a real word.
The python version has some additional features added over the C version.

##### NOTE:
NOTE: This program was completed as part of the course CS50 - Introduction
to Computer Science. The general framework of the C version, and some
of the functions were provided materials.
Most of the python version was written from scratch using the C version as
a framework.
