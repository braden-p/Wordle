Wordle Copy
Created by Braden Piper, bradenpiper.com
Created on Mon March 13, 2022
Version = 1.0
------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:
A copy of the popular game, Wordle, written in Python.
In this version, the user can choose the length of the word ranging from
5 to 8 letters words. The user has a set number of guesses to guess the
correct word.
Unlike the original wordle game, this version does not check if the user
input is a real word.
------------------------------------------
NOTE: Some of the structure of this program was inspired by an outline
of this program provided by CS50, Introduction to Computer Science. The
original program was completed in C, but this version in Python has more
features.
